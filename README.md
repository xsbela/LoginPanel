### Basic Login Page

This was a practice exercise from my **Ultima** course where we were challenged to create a login screen with some objectives and some of them are:

* Build the login screen with all elements visible.
* H1 or image
* span for the text “Log in”
* Text type inputs for email and password
* Checkbox type input for the “Remember me” option
* Tag a for the “Forget password?”
* Button for the “Connect” option
* Position all elements in the middle of the page using a main div
* After the login screen has been completed, develop the proposed improvements.
* Create a div to receive the side image
* Start by rounding the edges of the form inputs
* Change login button color from black to blue
* Decrease button curvature
* Add a link with the text “I want to create my account”
